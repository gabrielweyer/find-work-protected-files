# .NET Core Global Tool to find work protected files

List the files protected by [Windows Information Protection][wip]. This tool uses [Cipher.exe][cipher] to identify the work protected files.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/gabrielweyer/find-work-protected-files/_apis/build/status/gabrielweyer.find-work-protected-files?branchName=master)][build]

## Pre-requisites

- `Windows`
- [.NET Core SDK 2.2.104][dotnet-core-sdk]

Once you're done, run this command to initialise `Cake`:

```powershell
.\bootstrap.ps1
```

You can then run the build script:

```powershell
dotnet cake build.cake
```

If you want to pack the `.NET Core Global Tool` you can run: `dotnet cake build.cake --pack`

## Use the .NET Core global tool

The `Azure DevOps` [build][build] is publishing the global tool as a build artifact named `global-tool`

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global --add-source <directory-where-you-downloaded-the-package> dotnet-fwpf
```

You can then use it:

```powershell
dotnet fwpf C:\
```

## Sample output
